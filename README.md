# Alpha Test Sample

This is a development test project for Alpha Efficiency.

## Project Description

The test involves creating a fully functional website based on a Figma project. The website includes the implementation of a responsive design, which includes a burger menu for mobile and tablet versions, a dropdown feature for the FAQ section as well as a countdown feature to ensure users are aware of a limited-time special offer.

## UX/UI Improvements

Several UX/UI improvements have been made to enhance the overall look and feel of the website:

1. **Font Size Adjustments**: Font sizes have been carefully adjusted to create a better visual balance between background elements, titles, and images.

2. **Burger Menu Styling**: The burger menu design has been tailored for tablet devices to ensure an optimal user experience.

3. **Dropdown Animation**: The FAQ sections feature a smooth and engaging animation when dropping down, providing a more interactive user experience. Additionally, the button click triggers an animation, enhancing user engagement.

4. **Button and Element Effects**: Various elements, including buttons, cards, the navbar, and badges, have been enhanced with engaging effects to improve the overall user experience. These effects add interactivity and visual appeal.

5. **Clickable FAQ Items**: The FAQ section now allows users to click on the entire item for expanded details, not limited to just the button.

## Optimal Resolutions

To ensure the website's optimal display and functionality, you can view it at the following resolutions:

- **Mobile**: iPhone SE (width 375 pixels)
- **Tablet**: iPad Air (width 820 pixels)
- **Desktop**: Width greater than or equal to 1280 pixels
